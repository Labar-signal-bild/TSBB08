\section{Summary}
The goal of this laboration rapport is to show how one can segment cells in an
microscopy images and then locate and count padlock-signals in each cell.
The methods described in this rapport can be used on any microscopy image of decent quality.
But in this rapport we have primarily been working with image \ref{fig:ImColour},
which when divided into looks like image \ref{fig:CellLinesNCircles}.
In image \ref{fig:CellPart} we have isolated a single cell and counted its 14 padlock signals.

\section{Watershed segmentation 1} \label{sec:WatSeg1}
To get the image shown in image \ref{fig:CellLinesNCircles}, segmentation
on the original image has to be done. To do so the first step is to get an binary image over the
six cell kernels. This is done by threshholding image \ref{fig:ImColourBlue} which is
just the blue part of the original image. The threshold is determined by looking at
a histogram of image \ref{fig:ImColourBlue}. When the image is thresholded it still
contains some rubbish, see image \ref{fig:CellKernelsThreshRough}. By performing
opening and closing the rubbish is removed and image \ref{fig:CellKernelsThresSmooth} is received.

When a clean image over the cell kernels is made the watershed algorithm can be performed.
First a distance transform is made inside the objects, then the sign
of the distance transform is changed and the pixels outside the objects are set
to the minimum value, see image \ref{fig:CellKernelsDist} and image \ref{fig:CellKernelsDistInv}. All of the regional minimum values
are located and labeled. Image \ref{fig:CellKernelsMinimum} is a close up off some of the regional minimums that are found.
The purpose of finding regional minimum values is to get one minumum value in each cell kernel so that
the watershed transform algorithm can be executed. As shown in image \ref{fig:CellKernelsMinimum} there are
more then one minimum value in each kernel and also some "false minimum" inbetween kernels that are overlapping.
To get rid of these "false minimums" a demand on the depth of the minimum values are set. This removes some of the unwanted
minimums but there are still some extra minimums in the middle of the kernels. This
was solved by performing opening on the image which made the minimums in cell kernel centers close into a single shape,
see image \ref{fig:CellKernelsMinimumOpened}.

\section{Watershed segmentation 2}
In order to get a properly segmented image over the cell kernels with the
surrounding cytoplasm we start with the binary image \ref{fig:CellKernelsThresSmooth},we the preform a
simular watershed algorithm as in section \ref{sec:WatSeg1}. First a distance
map is performed outside of the cell kernels, see image \ref{fig:CellDist}. Then the distance map is
inverted and values lower then a threshold is set to that threshold.
Thresholding it and removing the cell kernels then gives image \ref{fig:CellBWMask}.
Removing the cell kernels from the center of the image is done in order to create centers for the
watershed algorithm to begin "filling" water. Before the watershed algorithm can
be applied the different centers need to be labeled, see image \ref{fig:CellCyto}.
After labeling, the watershed algorithm can be used, resulting in image \ref{fig:CellLabeled}.
From which the binary image \ref{fig:CellBw} can be created.
